# Claude Code Decision Tree Project Plan

## Overview
Transform the existing TSX demo into a full Next.js application with dark mode, then verify and enhance the decision tree logic through web research.

## Phase 1: Project Setup ✅
- [x] Initialize git repository
- [x] Create plan.md
- [x] Add initial demo file to git
- [x] Commit initial state

## Phase 2: Next.js Migration ✅
- [x] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
- [x] Move demo component to proper Next.js structure
- [x] Apply dark mode theme
- [x] Ensure all existing theming and styling is preserved
- [x] Set up development server
- [x] Test that everything works
- [x] Commit Next.js setup

## Phase 3: Decision Tree Analysis & Verification ✅
- [x] Extract all decision paths from the decision tree
- [x] Document each feature recommendation logic
- [x] Create structured data for verification
- [x] Design verification strategy for sub-agents
- [x] Deploy sub-agents to research each decision path
- [x] Collect research results
- [x] Analyze findings for accuracy
- [x] Document any discrepancies found
- [x] Commit analysis results

## Phase 4: Content Enhancement ✅
- [x] Review research findings
- [x] Update decision tree logic if errors found
- [x] Search for better real-world examples
- [x] Enhance feature descriptions
- [x] Improve recommendation reasons
- [x] Add more comprehensive implementation examples
- [x] Commit improvements

## Phase 5: Final Polish
- [ ] Ensure all features are accurately represented
- [ ] Verify all code examples work
- [ ] Add any missing edge cases
- [ ] Final testing of decision paths
- [ ] Commit final version

## Success Criteria
- Next.js app running with dark mode
- All decision paths verified against official Claude Code documentation
- Enhanced examples and descriptions based on research
- Comprehensive implementation guidance for each feature
