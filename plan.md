# Claude Code Decision Tree Project Plan

## Overview
Transform the existing TSX demo into a full Next.js application with dark mode, then verify and enhance the decision tree logic through web research.

## Phase 1: Project Setup âœ…
- [x] Initialize git repository
- [x] Create plan.md
- [ ] Add initial demo file to git
- [ ] Commit initial state

## Phase 2: Next.js Migration
- [ ] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
- [ ] Move demo component to proper Next.js structure
- [ ] Apply dark mode theme
- [ ] Ensure all existing theming and styling is preserved
- [ ] Set up development server
- [ ] Test that everything works
- [ ] Commit Next.js setup

## Phase 3: Decision Tree Analysis & Verification
- [ ] Extract all decision paths from the decision tree
- [ ] Document each feature recommendation logic
- [ ] Create structured data for verification
- [ ] Design verification strategy for sub-agents
- [ ] Deploy sub-agents to research each decision path
- [ ] Collect research results
- [ ] Analyze findings for accuracy
- [ ] Document any discrepancies found
- [ ] Commit analysis results

## Phase 4: Content Enhancement
- [ ] Review research findings
- [ ] Update decision tree logic if errors found
- [ ] Search for better real-world examples
- [ ] Enhance feature descriptions
- [ ] Improve recommendation reasons
- [ ] Add more comprehensive implementation examples
- [ ] Commit improvements

## Phase 5: Final Polish
- [ ] Ensure all features are accurately represented
- [ ] Verify all code examples work
- [ ] Add any missing edge cases
- [ ] Final testing of decision paths
- [ ] Commit final version

## Success Criteria
- Next.js app running with dark mode
- All decision paths verified against official Claude Code documentation
- Enhanced examples and descriptions based on research
- Comprehensive implementation guidance for each feature
